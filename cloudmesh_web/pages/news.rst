======================================================================

We are happy to announce the alpha release of cloudmesh. Cloudmesh is 
capable of interfacing with clouds and HPC frameworks. We have successfully 
demonstrated by our developers usage of

* OpenStack Clouds on FutureGrid (India, Sierra, Alamo)
* AWS
* Azure
* HP Cloud
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Cloud

At this time we only expose the FutuureGrid Sierra OpenStack cloud. We like to 
acknowledge all those that helped us developing Cloudmesh. 

A number of `screenshots </screenshots>`_ is available to showcase some of 
the features.

Thanks

Gregor von Laszewski and the rest of 

`the cloudmesh team </git>`_.
